# Fake-News-Detection
An analysis of the factors involved in the spread of false news has been published in this literature review. The root causes of the spread of fake news are established in this analysis in order to decrease the motivation of such false facts. The motives behind the circulation of fake news must first be identified in order to overcome the propagation of fake news on social media.This literature review thus takes an early initiative to establish the potential explanations behind the propagation of false news. The aim of this literature review is to understand why people appear to post misleading information before it spreads and to potentially help spot fake news.
